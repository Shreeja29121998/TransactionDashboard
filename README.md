Design an intuitive user interface (UI) using React JS components for login, register
account balance display, and transaction history.

Utilize state management libraries :
- Redux for managing application state
- Manage Exceptions(Error Boundary) ,
- UI performance(Suspense)
- API side effects(Saga)

Implement responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices and
screen sizes.

Login Page: Login page where users can securely log in using their credentials.

Register Page: User can register securely

Dashboard: After successful login, display the user's current account balance and recent
transaction history.

Balance Display: Show the user's current account balance prominently on the dashboard.

Transaction History: Display the user's recent transactions in a paginated manner, showing
details like date, amount, and transaction type.

Real-time Updates: Use WebSocket client libraries in React (e.g., Socket.IO client) to listen
for updates from the backend and automatically refresh the account balance and transaction
history in real-time.
